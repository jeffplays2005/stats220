## Q2.1

```R
manipulated_data <- {1} %>%
  mutate(num_words_title = {2}(title, "\\S+"),
    title_length = {3}(
      num_words_title < 5 ~ "short title",
      num_words_title < 10 ~ "medium title",
      TRUE ~ "long title"
    )
  )

{4} {5}
  ggplot() +
  geom_{6}({7}(x = {8}({9}, {10}),
    y = channelName)) +
  labs(x = "Length of title",
    y = "Channel") +
  theme({11} = element_rect(fill = "pink"))

{12}("title_count.png", width=8, height=4, units="in")
```

`str_count` takes in a string and a regex and counts number of words using `\\S+`
`geom_count` - points based on density of data
`reorder(x, y)` - used to reorder levels of `x` based on `y`. useful for sorting categorical axes in order. y can be -y

{1} - `youtube_data`
{2} - `str_count`
{3} - `case_when`
{4} - `manipulated_data`
{5} - `%>%`
{6} - `count`
{7} - `aes`
{8} - `reorder`
{9} - `title_length`
{10} - `num_words_title`
{11} - `plot.background`
{12} - `ggsave`

## Q2.2

The `geom_boxplot` isn't very good at showing the hour of the day, it would be much better to use `geom_density` which can show a better distribution of data when comparing different hours througout the day.

An example student answer: geom_boxplot considers the hour as a numerical variable, but dates don't really work as numeric variables, which will cause an average that doesn't really mean anything significant. A more appropriate geom to use would be a geom_dotplot, and analyse the peaks to see what times are most common for publishing videos, as averages only work when data makes sense as a numerical variable.

## Q2.3

Check lab 6A

1. A manipulation that is required is to mutate the title to get the words lowered with `str_to_lower` and using `seperate_rows` to and to remove punctuation by using `str_remove_all("[[:punct:]]")` and `str_squish` to remove any extra spaces.
2. Need to use `group_by` to group the data by channel name
3. Need to then `summarise` to calculate the mean title length and number of words in the title.
