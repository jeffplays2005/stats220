## Q1.1

## Q1.2

1. The JSON path is an absolute path, it should be relative as the project asked us to
2. The `if_else` statement is wrong, it should have 2 more parameters
3. They're mutating the tags wrong, its redundant
4. Context based slice, the code just sliced 1 : 50

## Q1.3

```R
photo_date <- read_csv("selected_data.csv")

summary_data <- photo_date %>%
  group_by(tag_nz) %>%
  summarise(median_views = median(views))
```

- {1} - read_csv
- {2} - group_by
- {3} - summarise
- {4} - views

The reason by it's `summarise` and not `mutate` is because the resulting data frame has only the grouped value, and the summarised value.

## Q1.4

Statement 1:

```R
nrow(photo_data)
```

Statement 2:

```R
max(photo_data$likes)
```

Statement 3:

```R
sum(str_detect(photo_data$tags, "mountain"))
```

Statement 4:

```R
summary_data$median_views[2]
```

## Q1.5

```R
popular_photos <- upload_info %>%
  mutate(date_uploaded = {1}(just_date),
    {2} = difftime(now(), date_uploaded, units = "{3}") %>% as.numeric(),
    views_per_day = {4}/days_since_uploaded)
```

`ymd` - year, month, day

- {1} - ymd
- {2} - days_since_uploaded
- {3} - days
- {4} - views

Find ID of the photo with the highest views:

```R
upload_info %>%
  arrange(desc(views_per_day)) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  pull(id)
```

`arrange` and `desc` sorts the views per day descending (largest first)

## Q1.6

A feature of JSON is that it is very similar to data frames in R code, it follows the same key-value format, such as `id` as the key and `DWu85...` as the value. Another feature of JSON is that it supports deep nesting, an example is `location` which nests to `position` and further nesting such as `latitude` and `longitude`. A potential limitation is that boolean values are all lowercase when in R code is all upper case, potentially could be hard to convert, e.g. `liked_by_user` is set to `false`.
