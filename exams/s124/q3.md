## Q3.1

```sql
SELECT airport, first_nz_trip, purpose_of_visit_main, no_days_in_nz
FROM tbl_visitor
WHERE airport = 'Auckland' AND purpose_of_visit_main = 'Business'
ORDER BY no_days_in_nz
```

## Q3.2

```sql
SELECT purpose_of_visit_main, ROUND(AVG(no_days_in_nz), 1) AS mean_days_in_nz
FROM tbl_visitor
GROUP BY purpose_of_visit_main
```

## Q3.3

A student wants to explore the relationship between the age of a visitor and how much they
spend on eating out.

```sql
SELECT age_range, cost_eating_out
    FROM tbl_visitor
    INNER JOIN tbl_expenditure_industry
    ON tbl_visitor.response_id = tbl_expenditure_industry.response_id;
```

Or to group the age range:

```sql
SELECT age_range, ROUND(AVG(cost_eating_out), 2) AS avg_cost_eating_out
    FROM tbl_visitor
    INNER JOIN tbl_expenditure_industry
    ON tbl_visitor.response_id = tbl_expenditure_industry.response_id
    GROUP BY age_range;
```

In no more than one sentence, explain how the data produced would help the student to carry
out this exploration.

Model answer:

```
The data produced will provide a combine dataset whcih include age range of each visitor and the amount that they spend on eatoing out, by joining tbl_visitor and tbl_expenditure_industry together based on a common key, which is the response_id.
```

Mine:

```
The data produced can proved a combined dataset, including the grouped age ranges of each visitor, and the amount of money that they spend on eating by joining the tbl_visitor table with tbl_expenditure_industry together on the common key of response_id.
```

## Q3.4

Consider the following statement: The primary key for each table in this database
is response_id

In no more than two sentences, explain why you agree or disagree with this statement.

Attempt 1:

```
I agree with this statement that the response_id is the primary key, this is because the ID is a unique identifier across all of the tables within the database (tbl_visitor, tbl_expenditure_industry, tbl_accomodation). The key ensures that each visitors data is linked across the 3 different tables corresponding with their data.
```

Attempt 2:

```
I agree with this statement because the response_id is unique for each visitor and is used as a common key to join the tbl_visitor and tbl_expenditure_industry tables. This ensures that each visitor's data is linked to their corresponding expenditure data, allowing for accurate analysis of the relationship between age and spending on eating out.
```

Both of the above are wrong...

```
I disagree with this statement because the response_id is not the primary key for each table in this database. There is a table, tbl_accomodation where there may be duplicate response_ids, which violates the definition of a primary key, the primary key for tbl_accomodation is accomodation_id.
```
