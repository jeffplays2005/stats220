Demo answer:

```
One issue I faced when completing Project 5 was scarping the data for album_genre. I tried various attempts at trying to obtain the information which were trials and errors, using various rvest functions to obtain it, eventually i was able to a value which included the album_genre along with various numbers and punctuations, I ended up using data manipulations from the stringr packaged, such as str_remove_all and str_squish so i could obtain just the album genre, after removing these using str_remove_all for [[:digit:]] and [[:punct:]] i used str_squish and finally was able to get the album genre.
