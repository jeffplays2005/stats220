The University of Auckland shares profiles about staff employed on a public website. Below is a screenshot of some of the profiles that are displayed when the word "statistics" is used to search for profiles.

Before attempting to scrape data about profiles, a STATS 220 student checked the following file(the robots.txt).

In no more than two short sentences, and with specific reference to the screenshots shown
above, discuss whether it is appropriate or responsible to scrape personal information about
University of Auckland staff from their public profile pages.

Note: seems like the answer should be more on the "no" side because it is unethical to scrape the personal information from their public profile pages as it violates the privacy of the staff members.

```
I made a note about referring back to Module 2, and considering people for all activities involving data. Beyond checking robots.txt and the terms and conditions, think of it from a personal perspective. Do you think it is ethical and responsible, for example, to use all the photos of UoA staff as part of training image AI models? Just because information is public, doesn't mean we can/should use it without any questions ðŸ˜€
