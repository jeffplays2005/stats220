Making specific references to the code provided, explain how the names of the lectures were able
to displayed in order from first (top bar) to last (bottom bar) in the visualisation from 1.4.

In the `students_per_recording` data frame, session names were filtered to be Lecture 1/2/3/4, this was then ordered using arrange(). The data frame then uses a mutate() function that helps future reference in ordering by giving each row a `lecture_num` that is based on the row number (supposedly sorted by the arrange function). This is then used in the ggplot with reorder() function that sorts y-axis by session name, based on ascending order.

Other answer:

```
By having the reorder in the ggplot, the session name was reorganised by their lecture number in ascending order as can seen by y=reorder(session_name, -lecture_num)
```
