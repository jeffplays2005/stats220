Briefly describe the data manipulations required to answer each question described in 2.3. Be careful to clearly explain which of your two questions the data manipulations relate to.

1. We would have to first use mutate() to create a new variable that counts the number of words in the trackName (using str_count()). We could use group_by() to group observations by the kind variable and then use summarise() to find the mean number of words for each group in kind.
2. We could do this by creating a new variable that counts the number of words and another one that measures the difference in time from now and the releaseDate. Using difftime() after we have converted the releaseDate variable into date time variable)
