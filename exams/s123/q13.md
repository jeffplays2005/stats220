Briefly describe one thing Anna could learn about STATS 220 students by using an inner join for `tbl_students` and `tbl_ed`. Be clear in your answer why an inner join is helpful/necessary.

```
Using an inner join could allow Anna to see the interaction between ed discussion posts and whether a student has taken compsci before. An inner join is helpful as it only keeps rows that match in both data frames so the resulting data frame would only include students in canvas (meaning they are taking the course) and who have made an ed discussion post. This allows Anna to analyse perhaps whether a higher proportion of ed discussion posts are made by students who hadnâ€™t taken compsci before.
