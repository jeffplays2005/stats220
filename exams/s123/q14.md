Briefly describe one thing Anna could learn about STATS 220 students by using a left join for
`tbl_students` and `tbl_ed`. Be clear in your answer why a left join is helpful/necessary.

A left join could help Anna learn what sort of student hasn’t made an ed discussion post before. A left join doesn’t lose any observations from the first data frame when joining and so it includes NA/NULL values for when a student hasn’t made a post. Thus, Anna could count the NA values and compare and contrast the proportion of compsci students who do and don’t make an ed discussion post.
