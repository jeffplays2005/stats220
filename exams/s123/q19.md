Anna wants to use the course prescriptions (descriptions) to create "fake" course prescriptions for Science courses.

Briefly discuss how both a for() loop and a while() loop could be used as part of this process.

Do not write any code for your answer.

```
The for() loop would be used for a specific amount of fake course presecriptions that is chosen to do with the while loop being used until a condition is met, similiar to a filter (i.e. the while loop is on the outside saying that until the course-prescriptions have 50 or more courses saying no pre-requisites or restrictions, the for loop runs 10 times creating fake courses).
```
