Using specific examples from Project 4, discuss TWO data-related responsibilities or issues you
needed to consider in Project 4, due to the nature of the data used in.

```
Project 4 involved us pulling data we had generated into a csv file using our personal gmail accounts. When using data such as this we need to be aware of privacy, i.e, if we had any personal information about ourself or others we would need to make sure we had permission to share this information or we would need to make this information anonymous or not include it. whenÂ taking this into consideration I only choose to only use data that was directly related to each of my university subjects so that i would exclude person information.
