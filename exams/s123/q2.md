The code looks through the `panopto_data` data frame and filters all session names that match "getting_started". It then selects the student number (solos that field out) and then cuts it down to only distinc student numbers and checks the number of these unique student numbers. All in all, the function gets the number of unique student numbers that have watched the getting started video.

Demo:

```
The goal of this code is to get all students who at least watch the getting* started video once and count how many of these students there are. This can be seen through the initial filter of getting* started, and then selecting only student numbers which creates a tibble with all the student numbers who have watched getting_started video, then the distinct) function makes sure only unque ones are kept (i.e. no duplicates) and then nrow() counts how many unique students there are.
```
