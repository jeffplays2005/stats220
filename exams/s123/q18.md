Identify TWO additions you would make to the code for scraping data about courses from the DCO website. Briefly discuss why you would make each code addition.

I would change the stage to be manipulated by adding a parameter within the paste and have another parameter within the function which allows for quick changing of stages for courses. I would also add a parameter to change the year it is looking at so that you can compare courses over time and what has changed.
