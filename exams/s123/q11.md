Anna has the two tables of data sourced from CANVAS and Ed Discussion: `tbl_students` and `tbl_ed`.

The diagram below shows the structure and just a couple of rows from each table (there are
hundreds more rows in both tables).

`tbl_students`:

| student_email           | student_name | done_compsi |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| am112@aucklanduni.ac.nz | Anna Martian | yes         |
| ma112@aucklanduni.ac.nz | Anna Banana  | no          |
| ...                     | ...          | ...         |

`tbl_ed`:

| student_email           | post_title            | view_date  |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | ---------- |
| am112@aucklanduni.ac.nz | Welcome to STATS 220! | 01/04/2023 |
| ma112@aucklanduni.ac.nz | Dangerous code?       | 22/05/2023 |
| ...                     | ...                   | ...        |

Briefly discuss if the column/variable `student_email` can be considered the primary key for both
`tbl_students` and `tbl_ed`.

No the `student_email` field can be considered the primary key fo both of the tables. This is because the student email cannot act as a unique identifier for `tbl_ed`, there may be multiple posts with different titles that the same student email viewed, hence this violates the definiton of a primary key.
