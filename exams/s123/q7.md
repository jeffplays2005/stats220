Data was sourced from the iTunes API for tracks using the search term "number".

R code and functions from {jsonlite} and {dplyr} were then used to create a new data frame
`track_data`.

The first 15 rows of `track_data` are shown below.

The code below provides the code used to create `track_data` but some parts of the code have been replaced with numbers.

```R
query1 <- "..."
response1 <- fromJSON(query1)
{1} <- response1$results

query2 <- "..."
response2 <- fromJSON({2})
track_data2 <- response2$results

track_data <- {3}(track_data1, {4}) %>%
  {5}(wrapperType, {6}, trackid, trackName, releaseDate)
```

- {1} - `track_data1`
- {2} - `query2`
- {3} - `bind_rows`
- {4} - `track_data2`
- {5} - `select`
- {6} - `kind`
