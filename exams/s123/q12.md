```sql
SELECT done_compsci, COUNT(student_email) AS num_students
FROM tbl_students
GROUP BY done_compsci
```

Briefly describe the output of this code and what {tidyverse} functions could produce a similar output.

```
This code is selecting the done_compsci column and then creating a new variable called num_students that is counting student_email. They are selecting these 2 columns from the tbl_students data frame. Then we are grouping them by the variable done_compsci. In tidyverse, this could be done using the select(), group_by(), summarise(), and n() functions.
```

```
The code will produce a table with two columns - done_compsci and num_students, and two rows (one for each level of done_compsci , i.e, no, yes, with the counts of students for each level in the cells for the second column.
```

```R
tbl_students %>%
  group_by(done_compsci) %>%
  summarise(num_students=n())
```
