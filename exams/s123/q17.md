The University of Auckland makes digital course outlines available on the DCO website: https://courseoutline.auckland.ac.nz/dco.

A search for all courses offered by the Faculty of Science during Semester One 2023 returned 354 matches over 15 different pages, with up to 25 courses displayed on each page.

Anna used functions from the packages {tidyverse} and {rvest} and examples demonstrated in the STATS 220 lectures and labs to scrape the course prescriptions (descriptions) for all 354 courses, to create the data frame `course_data`.

The code below provides the code used to create `course_data` but some parts of the code have been replaced with numbers.

```R
course_data <- {1} ({2} : {3}, function(i) {
  url <- {4}("https://courseoutline.auckland.ac.nz/dco/course/advanceSearch? advanceSearchText=&termCodeYear=123&termCodeTerm=3&facultyld=4000&organisationCode=&stage=&pageNumber", {5})

  page <- read_html({6})

  course_prescription <- page %>%
    {7}("{8}") %>%
    {9}()

  {10}(course_prescription)
}
```

- {1} - `map_df`
- {2} - `0`
- {3} - `14` (note that pages start from 0, hence there are 15 pages from 354/25)
- {4} - `paste0`
- {5} - `i`
- {6} - `url`
- {7} - `html_elements`
- {8} - `.course-prescription`
- {9} - `html_text2`
- {10} - `return`
