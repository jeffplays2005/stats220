## How Relevant are your Shorts?
This STATS 220 project has a strong focus on analysing and gathering data on how relevant your shorts are.

How relevant consider the shorts that you double tapped (liked)?

How relevant do you consider the shorts that you skipped?

```{r}
# Read the live data fetched from Google Forms
csv_url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQQsnK3yQ3KQXql3aXCS0ujXL_eQYKC6LqyZg2mbyTNNn_jwdjkWKwaNJER7r0AOisfqaVQMQNXe0RD/pub?gid=415582428&single=true&output=csv"
logged_data <- read_csv(csv_url)

# # Rename the columns to make them more readable
latest_data <- rename(logged_data,
    shorts_watched=2,
    session_length=3,
    shorts_liked=4,
    shorts_skipped=5,
    most_shown_topic=6,
    liked_shorts_relevancy=7,
    skipped_shorts_relevancy=8
)
```

```{r}
# Generate some statistics
average_shorts_watched <- mean(latest_data$shorts_watched)
number_of_responses <- nrow(latest_data)
maximum_session_length <- max(latest_data$session_length)
minimum_session_length <- min(latest_data$session_length)
```

Here are some results based on the survey conducted:

```{r}
paste("The total number of individuals that completed the survey is:", number_of_responses)
paste("The average number of shorts individuals watch are:", average_shorts_watched)
paste("The maximum session time recorded was", maximum_session_length, "and the minimum session time recorded was", minimum_session_length)
```

## What's the most shown topic in your session?

The chart below analyses the data gathered and observes the most shown topic of your shorts.

```{r fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(latest_data) +
    geom_bar(aes(x = most_shown_topic)) +
    labs(title = "Most Shown Topics in Shorts", x = "Topic", y = "Count")
```

## How relevant are the shorts you liked?

The plot below shows the relevancy of the shorts liked with a contrast to the relevancy rating given.

```{r fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(latest_data) +
    geom_bar(aes(x = shorts_liked, fill = liked_shorts_relevancy)) +
    labs(title = "Relevance rating of liked shorts compared to number of shorts liked", x = "Relevance Rating", y = "Shorts liked")
```

## How relevant are the shorts you skipped?

The plot below shows the relevancy of shorts skipped.

```{r fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(latest_data) +
    geom_bar(aes(x = skipped_shorts_relevancy, fill = shorts_skipped)) +
    labs(title = "Relevance rating of skipped shorts compared to number of shorts skipped", x = "Relevance Rating", y = "Count")
```

```{r}
pets <- c("cat", "dog", "turtle", "rabbit")
best_pet <- pets[1]
```

The best pet to have is a `r best_pet` of course!
