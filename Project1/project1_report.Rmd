## Project requirements
![Project structure picture](./project_structure.png)

Here is a [link to my stats220 GitHub page](https://github.com/jeffplays2005/stats220/tree/main)!

## Inspo meme

Inspirational meme:
![inspo meme](https://preview.redd.it/7ft5x40g08471.jpg?auto=webp&s=c4e3a13b171ae732b9898a216a099010fd531e01)

The key components towards this meme is that there is a single image as the focus and a single line of text at the top annotating the meme. 

## My meme

![](./my_meme.png)

I changed the following in my meme:

* The image
* The text formatting, there are two lines of text, one at the top, one at the bottom.
* The text is also different but bases off of a similar idea in the inspirational meme. 

## My animated meme

## Creativity

My project demonstrates creativity because of the following reasons:

* My animation is based off of 4 different frames.
  * Each of the frames have the same style as the other frames so there is a uniform style across the animation.
* My project changes the text and uses a header **and** a footer!
* My project uses a good sense of humor!!
* There is a creative usage of CSS in combination with this markdown to give a nice theme!
  * There is a gradient that has a similar theme to my inspirational image colours.
  * I change the font to a different one that looks a bit more "pok√©mon themed"
  * Images have a hover effect that applies a darker light-blue with a transition time. 
  * Font colour changed for h2 and h3!

## Learning reflection

A very important idea I learnt is a lot of the crucial methods/functions that the `magick` library uses! For example, I learnt how to read, scale, annotate, and combine images! This is a very important skill as I had a project involving some basic image processing and R language seems very fast at doing this.

I'm just more curious on learning how fast R language actually runs, estimates of how fast image processing/editing is. The project I had in mind would preferably have a fast image editor that optimally doesn't require a computationally expensive component to render quickly. I'm also quite curious as to if we have any more image processing, this was very fun and interesting to do!

## Appendix

<mark>Do not change, edit, or remove the `R` chunk included below.</mark>

If you are working within RStudio and within your Project1 RStudio project (check the top right-hand corner says "Project1"), then the code from the `meme.R` script will be displayed below.

This code needs to be visible for your project to be marked appropriately, as some of the criteria are based on this code being submitted.


```{r file='meme.R', eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

```
