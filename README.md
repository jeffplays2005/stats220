This is my repo for STATS 220.

## A little about me:

* I am taking STATS 220 because I want to learn the R language!
* I'm interested in learning about R lang and more markdown!
* I'm *currently* interested in react.js and next.js!
* I'm currently working on the [UABC's website](https://uabc.wdcc.co.nz)!
